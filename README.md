## Land Sector Management & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Nigeria & Lagos
This repository contains datasets and Jupyter Notebooks for the analysis of land sector management within Nigeria, with a specific focus on Lagos. The analysis is part of an initiative to bring together various datasets that can significantly impact land sector management, conservation efforts, and ecological assessments.

### Project Overview
The project involves the utilization of geospatial data to understand the land composition within Nigeria and Lagos. The analysis encompasses several ecological and environmental aspects, including:

1. Geospatial Data Exploration: Initial assessment and visualization of various geospatial datasets, providing foundational insights for further analysis.
2. Administrative Boundaries Analysis: Examination and visualization of Nigeria's administrative boundaries, crucial for understanding regional and local land management policies.
3. Biodiversity Hotspots Analysis: Identification of critical biodiversity hotspots within Nigeria and Lagos, highlighting regions that require conservation priority.
4. Forest Cover and Ecological Zones Analysis: Detailed analysis of forest cover and ecological zones, revealing the extent and distribution of various forest types and ecological regions.


### Key Insights
Nigeria presents a diverse ecological landscape, hosting various forest types like tropical dry forests, moist forests, mountain systems, and rainforests.
Lagos, primarily covered by tropical rainforests, falls within the "Guinean Forests of West Africa" biodiversity hotspot.
The geospatial exploration underscores the significance of these regions for biodiversity, necessitating urgent conservation measures.
